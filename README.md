## Automated Testing Engine
### Project Overview
The _Intelligent Tutoring System_ (ITS) provides automated feedback and grading suggestions for programming assignments. As the architecture and functionality of the ITS expand, there is a need to ensure that the growing code base is maintained at high quality.

Therefore, our team has developed an automated testing engine that aims to identify existing bugs in the [ITS API](https://its.comp.nus.edu.sg/docs#/). Our solution revolves around **metamorphic testing**, where we develop metamorphic relations to identify variants of successful test cases that are potentially bug-inducing in the context of the ITS.
