## Background

The _Intelligent Tutoring System_ (ITS) is developed at the _Programming Languages and Software Engineering lab_ at _School of Computing, National University of Singapore_. It  provides automated feedback and grading suggestions for programming assignments. As the architecture and functionality of the ITS expand, there is a need to ensure that the growing code base is maintained at high quality.

## Project Overview

Our team has developed an automated testing engine that uses **black box testing** to identify existing bugs in the [ITS API](https://its.comp.nus.edu.sg/docs#/).

Our solution revolves around **metamorphic testing**, where we develop metamorphic relations around the high level insight of **semantic equivalence**. We modify base Python programs into semantically equivalent ones using [Python AST](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html), then put both the base and modified programs into the ITS API. If it deems them to be semantically unequivalent, it hints at a possible bug.

## Strategy Overview
The main steps of our testing strategy are:
1. Generate a random base Python program.
2. Generate random arguments for the base program.
3. Modify the base program using metamorphic relations to obtain a modified program.
4. Put the base and modified programs into the ITS API, where they act as **test oracles** for one another.

## Project Setup
1. Ensure that you have Python and Docker installed. Otherwise, you can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

2. Clone the repository to a local directory of your preference.
```
git clone https://github.com/cs3213-fse-2024/automated-testing-engine-group-18.git
```

3. In the root directory, create a `.env` file. Inside the file, enter an [OpenAI API key](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-openai-api-key). If you do not have a key, you would be unable to use the `OpenAiProgramGenerator` to generate base programs, but you can rely on alternative base program generators instead.
```
CS3213_OPENAI_API_KEY="<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>"
```

4. Run `docker build . -t automated-test-engine` in command prompt to build the Docker image.


5. Run `docker run -v "<current_working_directory>":/app -it --entrypoint /bin/sh automated-test-engine` in command prompt to start the Docker container, and map the current working directory to the `/app` directory in the container.

6. Run `poetry install` to install the required dependencies in the docker container.

7. Run `poetry shell` to activate the virtual environment.

> Note: Replace `<current_working_directory>` with the path to the current working directory.

> Run all the commands from Step 6 onwards in the Docker container.



## Running The Test Engine
The entry point of the application is [`main.py`](its_test_engine/main.py).

We have implemented a total of 13 metamorphic modifiers. Each transforms a base program into a semantically equivalent one in a unique way.

No other functionalities are associated with those lists.                                                              |


You can choose which combinations of modifiers to test for, and how many test cases to run. However, we do not recommend combining too many at once, as some modifiers may conflict with one another and having more modifiers takes longer to generate the test cases. 

1. In the methods `run_leetcode_programs()` and `run_open_ai_programs()` of `main.py`, there is a variable called `transformers`. This is a list of modifiers. You can put in any combination of modifiers you want to test for using the 13 modifiers shown above. For `run_open_ai_programs()`, note that you can also specify constraints for `OpenAiProgramGenerator`, to generate base programs that satisfy certain criteria, in order to be applicable for the metamorphic relations that you have chosen.
2. In the block of `if __name__ == "__main__"`, you can choose which base program generator to use, and how many test cases to run for. For example, using `run_leetcode_programs(2)` would run 2 test cases with base programs generated by `LeetCodeProgramGenerator`. For those without an OpenAI API key, you should comment out `run_open_ai_programs(2)` as you do not have access to OpenAI models for base program generation.
3. You can run `python its_test_engine/main.py` from the root directory, while in the docker container, to start generating the test results. Test results reports are generated in the [`test_results`](test_results) folder.


## Test Results and Bug Reports
We have raised a total of 26 bug reports. **20 out of 26** bug reports were accepted as valid bugs. The bug reports can be found in the [`bug_reports`](bug_reports) folder. They reference test results reports which are found in the [`test_results`](test_results) folder.

The bug reports were manually written by us after analysing the output we obtained from the ITS API, while the test results reports are lower-level logs automatically generated as part of our pipeline.

## Running Unit and Integration Tests
We have written unit and integration tests for the automated testing engine, achieving line and branch coverage of 99%.

1. To run the test cases, run `pytest`.

2. To generate a test coverage report, there are 2 options:

```
# Line Coverage
coverage run --source=its_test_engine -m pytest && coverage report --show-missing

# Branch Coverage
coverage run --branch --source=its_test_engine -m pytest && coverage report --show-missing
```

> Run all the commands in the Docker container.
